                                    Khuushuur is a meat pastry or dumpling
                                    popular in Mongolia that is relatively
                                    similar to Russian and other cuisines like
                                    chiburekki or Garlic chives wrap. The meat,
                                    beef, mutton, or camel, is ground up and
                                    mixed with onion (or garlic), salt and other
                                    spices. The cook rolls the dough into
                                    circles, then places the meat inside the
                                    dough and folds the dough in half, creating
                                    a flat half-circular pocket. The cook then
                                    closes the pockets by pressing the edges
                                    together. A variety of Khuushuur has a round
                                    shape produced by pressing the dough and
                                    mince together using the dough roller.

                                    An escalope is a piece of boneless meat that
                                    has been thinned out using a mallet or
                                    rolling pin or beaten with the handle of a
                                    knife, or merely butterflied. The mallet
                                    breaks down the fibers in the meat, making
                                    it more tender. But the thinner meat cooks
                                    faster with more moisture loss. The meat is
                                    then coated and fried. The term escalope is
                                    also applied to potatoes that have been
                                    thinly sliced. Potatoes prepared in this
                                    manner are often called "scallops"

                                    Jalisco. The dish is a meat stew
                                    traditionally made from goat meat, but
                                    occasionally made from beef or mutton. The
                                    dish is often served at celebratory
                                    occasions, such as weddings and baptisms,
                                    and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter.
                                    Preparation techniques vary, but the dish is
                                    often served with corn tortillas, onion,
                                    cilantro and lime. The meat is marinated in

                                    herbs, and spices before being cooked in a

                                    Yakiniku , meaning "grilled meat", is a
                                    Japanese term that, in its broadest sense,
                                    refers to grilled meat cuisine. "Yakiniku"
                                    originally referred to western "barbecue"
                                    food, the term being popularized by Japanese
                                    writer Kanagaki Robun in his Seiyo Ryoritsu
                                    (i.e. "western food handbook") in 1872
                                    (Meiji period). The term later became
                                    associated with Korean-derived cuisine
                                    during the early Shōwa period. Due to the
                                    Korean War, the terms associated with Korea
                                    in Japan were divided into North Korea (Kita
                                    Chōsen) and South Korea (Kankoku); the
                                    reference to a "yakiniku restaurant" arose
                                    as a politically correct term for
                                    restaurants of either origin.
